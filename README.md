Clone of the Daleks game

I created this game for my relative who had gotten hooked on the original Daleks by Johan Strandberg. The initial goal was a faithful reproduction for a windows machine but then it became something else. I hope you enjoy it.

Game is created using FreeBASIC 1.05 32bit windows version and FB IDE.
